CARGO - build system and package manager

cargo new *name* - new project

cargo build - builds the project and creates an executable in /target/debug/ with the name same as name of the project

./target/debug/*executable* - run

cargo run - cargo build + running

cargo check - only to check if the project compiles, does not create an executable, faster

cargo build --release - building with all the optimizations, slower but the final runtime is as fast as possible
